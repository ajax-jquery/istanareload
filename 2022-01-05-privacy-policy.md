<h1 style="text-align: left;">Your Rights</h1>

<p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><em>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em></h2>

<p>If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>

<ul><li>Request access to your personal data;</li><li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li><li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li><li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li><li>Request portability of your personal data.</li></ul>

<p>You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><em>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</em></h2>

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it.</p>

<p>The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:</p>

<ul><li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li><li>Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);</li><li>Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services);</li><li>Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);</li><li>Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);</li><li>Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application); and</li><li>Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).</li></ul>

<p>You can find more information about what we collect in the&nbsp;Information We Collect section&nbsp;above.</p>

<p>We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the&nbsp;How and Why We Use Information section. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the&nbsp;Sharing Information section.</p>

<p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:</p>

<ul><li>Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;</li><li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li><li>Opt out of any sale of personal information; and</li><li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</li></ul>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The CCPA &amp; Personalized Advertising in Our Ads Program</strong></h2>

<p>Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible. We show ads on some of our users’ sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn’t become an obstacle to having a voice. Our ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites. As part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users’ sites and some of our own.</p>

<p>The personal information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address). These disclosures may be considered a “sale” of information under the CCPA. We do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information. Learn how you can opt out by going to&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.com/advertising-program-optout/">California: Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Contacting Us About These Rights</h2>

<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to “<a href="https://wa.me/6282336155333?text=">How to Reach Us</a>” to, well, find out how to reach us.</p>

<p>When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Controllers and Responsible Companies</h2>

<p>Automattic’s Services are worldwide. Different Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.</p>

Generally, the “controller” is the Automattic company that entered into the contract with you under the Terms of Service for the product or service you use.
